    <div class="descrip">JAUP (Just Another Useless Page) is a website with random stuff
        for entertainment purposes. This was created by a guy nicknamed Beriekhoi who can be found in
        the main page. The purpose of creating this website was basically to have some fun
        and distract yourself a little bit from the world. Even I enjoyed while doing this so 
        it's as good for you as it's for me. Whenever I have more ideas, I'll add more stuff to
        this and if you wanna suggest something send me a DM:
