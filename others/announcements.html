        Hello, recently I added some games to the website so you can play them, but there was a problem.
        Github users may now that the maximum amount of files in a repository is 100 files, and these games were a lot.
        They were aproximately 95 files, even tho I had to delete some of them beause it was too much, so I'm planning to create
        a new website where you can play the games.
        <br><br>
        Edit: It's done. You can visit it <a href="https://jarw-games.netlify.app/">here</a>

        Hello guys, it's me again. Just a short announcement to remind you that if you go to the main page
        and it redirects you to the 404 page even thi you typed the URL right, it's most probably because
        I'm uploading the index file ;)

        Hey there! Welcome to JARW (Just Another Random Website), the website with a "variety" of fun
        things (and I say "variety" because it's not really that much) where you can have fun and
        suggest more things that I can put in this website. This page was created by a Mexican guy
        called Gabriel (known also as Beriekhoi) which was just bored and decided to make this thing.
        All announcements will stay here forever, and I hope you have fun with
        this basic website.
