        Hey there! Welcome to JARW (Just Another Random Website), the website with a "variety" of fun
        things (and I say "variety" because it's not really that much) where you can have fun and
        suggest more things that I can put in this website. This page was created by a Mexican guy
        called Gabriel (known also as Beriekhoi) which was just bored and decided to make this thing.
        All announcements will stay here forever, and I hope you have fun with
        this basic website.
