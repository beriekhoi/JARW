        Hello guys, it's me again. Just a short announcement to remind you that if you go to the main page
        and it redirects you to the 404 page even thi you typed the URL right, it's most probably because
        I'm uploading the index file ;)

        Hi, I'm sorry to announce that I won't be updating daily stuff because I've had some problems with my
        laptop. I hope you can understand and I'm really sorry. I'll solve it in a few days so don't worry :)
        This is the only thing that I'll update for now and I'll let you know when I solve this problem, and
        as well I'll update the daily stuff.

        Hey there! Welcome to JARW (Just Another Random Website), the website with a "variety" of fun
        things (and I say "variety" because it's not really that much) where you can have fun and
        suggest more things that I can put in this website. This page was created by a Mexican guy
        called Gabriel (known also as Beriekhoi) which was just bored and decided to make this thing.
        All announcements will stay here forever, and I hope you have fun with
        this basic website.
